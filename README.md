# Project 2, React App: All The Stars

**Title**: All The Stars

**Description**

All The Stars is an astrology application, where the user will have the option to choose their sun sign and read information related to that sign. My goal is for this to be a fun app where a user could get some basic astrological information and maybe be intrigued enough to learn more.

This current version priotizes changes made with the intention of making the application more aeshtetically pleasing. The choices I made are based on knowledge I've acquired on design, inlcluding choosing color palettes, typography and hierarchy of text.



**API Documentation**

This is the link containing the full documentation to successfully use the API https://jps-tarot-api.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html.

**Miniumum Need To Have Features**

The minimum features for my API are the functions on the Sun Sign Astrology page, where the user will be able to choose their sign from a list of all 12 (using a drop-down list) and view information pertaining to that sign. Also, a functional Navigation Bar.

**Post MVP**

Post MVP I'd want to convert this to Swift and upload it onto TestFlight. Also Iâ€™d like for users to have the option to look at their whole birth chart within the app.

**Built With**

Built using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and the React library.
