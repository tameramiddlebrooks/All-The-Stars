**Description**
My react app is a horoscope app, where the user will have the option to choose their sun sign and read their horoscope for the day. My goal is for this to be a fun app where a user could potentially log on at any point in their day, read their horoscope and be excited/intrigued by it, and learn a little bit more about their sun sign too.

**API**
The API that I used is the aztro API, made by Sameer Kumar, which provides real-time horoscope and astrology information. Here is the API link: https://aztro.sameerkumar.website/

**API Documentation**
This is the link containing the full documentation to successfully use the aztro API: https://aztro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

**Miniumum Need To Have Features**
The minimum features for my API are the functions on the Horoscope page, where the user will be able to choose their sign and view their horoscope. The minimum features for this page are a way for the user to view all 12 sun signs and choose one (either a drop-down list, 12 clickable buttons or cards containing each sign, etc). The app also needs a function Navigation Bar.

**Post MVP**
Post MVP I'd  want to add music to the API, there are quite a few songs and albums that have an astrology theme to them so I feel like that’d be a nice, fun touch. Also I’d like for users to have the option to look at a detailed summary of their sun sign instead of only reading their horoscope, so I'd want to include the option for users to look at their whole birth chart within the app instead of another website.
